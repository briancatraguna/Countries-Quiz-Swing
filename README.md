# Countries Quiz
A Java based desktop quiz application that focuses on testing your knowledge about different countries. The application is built using Java's Swing library for the graphical user interface, Java Sockets for Networking and Threads for efficient management of concurrent operations. Submitted for my final project in NYU9053 (Intro to Java) course
